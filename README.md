Overview

DX11 Cube Engine is a basic graphics engine built using DirectX 11. Its primary function is to generate and render cubes based on a user-defined count. This project was developed purely for learning purposes, serving as an exploration of the DirectX 11 API, rendering pipeline, and basic engine architecture.

Features

Renders multiple cubes based on user input.

Implements a simple DirectX 11 rendering pipeline.

Provides a foundational understanding of DirectX 11 concepts such as buffers, shaders, and rendering loops.

Purpose

This engine was not designed to be a fully-fledged game engine but rather as a way to gain hands-on experience with DirectX 11. It was developed to:

Understand how DirectX 11 handles rendering.

Experiment with buffers, shaders, and basic transformations.

Serve as a stepping stone for more complex graphics programming projects.

Requirements

Windows OS

Visual Studio (recommended for compiling)

DirectX 11 SDK

How to Use

Clone the repository.

Open the project in Visual Studio.

Compile and run the application.
